#' Package for Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using traditional statistical methods on (potentially heterogenous) cross-section and panel data
#'
#' This package provides a collection of methods for doing SFA (Stochastic frontier analysis) based on traditional statistical techniques.
#' It was inspired by some existing software for SFA (R packages frontier, sfa and Benchmarking, STATA commands frontier, xtfrontier and sfcross/sfpanel) but it aims to be
#' more comprehansive, modular/extendable and open (open source).
